## Get the code

- check out and install the [depot_tools package](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up).
- create browser-android-tabs dir

  `mkdir browser-android-tabs`

- clone the repository to src folder:

  `git clone https://github.com/brave/browser-android-tabs.git src`
  
## Configure your build (You can only use a Linux build machine for Android builds)

- you have to install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#linux-tab). We use it for sync functionality.

- run script and it will download all third-parties. You will be asked for some interaction during that process. Follow that link when you asked to create a gn file [gn file for debug](https://github.com/brave/browser-android-tabs/wiki/Sample-gn-file-for-debug)

  `sh scripts/getThirdParties.js`
  
## Build the full browser in debug mode

- build browser:

  `ninja -C out/Default chrome_public_apk`
  
  If you have an error that it could not find the build.ninja file follow those steps:
    - run `gn args out/Default` manually and fill it using that link [gn file for debug](https://github.com/brave/browser-android-tabs/wiki/Sample-gn-file-for-debug)
    - start `ninja -C out/Default chrome_public_apk` again.
  
- deploy it to your Android device:

  `build/android/adb_install_apk.py out/Default/apks/Brave.apk`
  
## Build the full browser in release mode

- follow the link [Make release builds](https://github.com/brave/browser-android-tabs/wiki/Make-release-builds)
